# Stack-queue pseudo

## Problem statement

Create a new class called pseudo queue.
- Do not use an existing Queue.
- Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface with two methods:
  - **enqueue**
    - Arguments: value
    - Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach
  - **dequeue**
    - Arguments: none
    - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach
- Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
